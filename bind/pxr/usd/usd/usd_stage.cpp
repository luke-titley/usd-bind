/// \class UsdStage
/// 
/// The outermost container for scene description, which owns and presents
/// composed prims as a scenegraph, following the composition recipe
/// recursively described in its associated "root layer".
/// 
/// USD derives its persistent-storage scalability by combining and reusing
/// simple compositions into richer aggregates using referencing and layering
/// with sparse overrides.  Ultimately, every composition (i.e. "scene") is
/// identifiable by its root layer, i.e. the <tt>.usd</tt> file, and a scene
/// is instantiated in an application on a UsdStage that presents a composed
/// view of the scene's root layer.  Each simple composition referenced into
/// a larger composition could be presented on its own UsdStage, at the same
/// (or not) time that it is participating in the larger composition on its
/// own UsdStage; all of the underlying layers will be shared by the two
/// stages, while each maintains its own scenegraph of composed prims.
/// 
/// A UsdStage has sole ownership over the UsdPrim 's with which it is populated,
/// and retains *shared* ownership (with other stages and direct clients of
/// SdfLayer's, via the Sdf_LayerRegistry that underlies all SdfLayer creation
/// methods) of layers.  It provides roughly five categories of API that
/// address different aspects of scene management:
/// 
/// - \ref Usd_lifetimeManagement "Stage lifetime management" methods for
/// constructing and initially populating a UsdStage from an existing layer
/// file, or one that will be created as a result, in memory or on the 
/// filesystem.
/// - \ref Usd_workingSetManagement "Load/unload working set management" methods
/// that allow you to specify which \ref Usd_Payloads "payloads" should be
/// included and excluded from the stage's composition.
/// - \ref Usd_variantManagement "Variant management" methods to manage
/// policy for which variant to use when composing prims that provide
/// a named variant set, but do not specify a selection.
/// - \ref Usd_primManagement "Prim access, creation, and mutation" methods
/// that allow you to find, create, or remove a prim identified by a path on
/// the stage.  This group also provides methods for efficiently traversing the
/// prims on the stage.
/// - \ref Usd_layerManagement "Layers and EditTargets" methods provide access
/// to the layers in the stage's <em>root LayerStack</em> (i.e. the root layer
/// and all of its recursive sublayers), and the ability to set a UsdEditTarget
/// into which all subsequent mutations to objects associated with the stage
/// (e.g. prims, properties, etc) will go.
/// - \ref Usd_stageSerialization "Serialization" methods for "flattening" a
/// composition (to varying degrees), and exporting a completely flattened
/// view of the stage to a string or file.  These methods can be very useful
/// for targetted asset optimization and debugging, though care should be 
/// exercized with large scenes, as flattening defeats some of the benefits of
/// referenced scene description, and may produce very large results, 
/// especially in file formats that do not support data de-duplication, like
/// the usda ASCII format!
/// 
/// \section Usd_SessionLayer Stage Session Layers
/// 
/// Each UsdStage can possess an optional "session layer".  The purpose of
/// a session layer is to hold ephemeral edits that modify a UsdStage's contents
/// or behavior in a way that is useful to the client, but should not be
/// considered as permanent mutations to be recorded upon export.  A very 
/// common use of session layers is to make variant selections, to pick a
/// specific LOD or shading variation, for example.  The session layer is
/// also frequently used to perform interactive vising/invsning of geometry
/// and assets in the scene.   A session layer, if present, contributes to a 
/// UsdStage's identity, for purposes of stage-caching, etc.
