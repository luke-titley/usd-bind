/// \class UsdAttribute
/// 
/// Scenegraph object for authoring and retrieving numeric, string, and array
/// valued data, sampled over time.
/// 
/// The allowed value types for UsdAttribute are dictated by the Sdf
/// ("Scene Description Foundations") core's data model, which we summarize in
/// \ref Usd_Page_Datatypes .
/// 
/// \section Usd_AttributeQualities Attribute Defining Qualities
/// 
/// In addition to its value type, an Attribute has two other defining
/// qualities:
/// - <b>Variability</b> Expresses whether an attribute is intended to
/// have time samples (GetVariability() == *SdfVariabilityVarying*), or only
/// a default (GetVariability() == *SdfVariabilityUniform*).  For more on
/// reasoning about time samples, 
/// see \ref Usd_AttributeValueMethods "Value & Time-Sample Accessors".
/// 
/// - <b>Custom</b> Determines whether an attribute belongs to a
/// schema (IsCustom() == *false*), or is a user-defined, custom attribute.
/// schema attributes will always be defined on a prim of the schema type,
/// ans may possess fallback values from the schema, whereas custom 
/// attributes must always first be authored in order to be defined.  Note
/// that *custom* is actually an aspect of UsdProperty, as UsdRelationship
/// can also be custom or provided by a schema.
/// 
/// \section Usd_AttributeExistence Attribute Creation and Existence
/// 
/// One can always create an attribute generically via 
/// UsdPrim::CreateAttribute(), which ensures that an attribute "is defined"
/// in the current \ref UsdEditTarget .  In order to author any metadata or
/// a default or timesample for an attribute, <em>it must first be defined</em>.
/// It is sufficient that the attribute be defined in any one of the layers
/// participating in the stage's current composition; for *builtin* 
/// attributes (those belonging to the owning prim's defining schema, i.e.
/// the most specific subclass of UsdTypedSchema for which prim.IsA<schema>()
/// will evaluate to true) there need be no authored scene description, because
/// a definition is provided by the prim's schema definition.
/// 
/// <b>Creating</b> an attribute does not imply that the attribute has a value.
/// More broadly, in the following code:
/// ```
/// if (UsdAttribute attr = prim.GetAttribute(TfToken("myAttr"))){
///    ...
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// The UsdAttribute passes the bool test, because it is defined; however, 
/// inside the clause, we have no guarantee that attr has a value.
/// 
/// \section Usd_AttributeInterpolation Attribute Value Interpolation
/// 
/// UsdAttribute supports two interpolation behaviors when retrieving
/// attribute values at times where no value is explicitly authored.
/// The desired behavior may be specified via UsdStage::SetInterpolationType.
/// That behavior will be used for all calls to UsdAttribute::Get.
/// 
/// The supported interpolation types are:
/// 
/// - <b>Held</b> Attribute values are held constant between authored
/// values.  An attribute's value will be equal to the nearest preceding
/// authored value.  If there is no preceding authored value, the value 
/// will be equal to the nearest subsequent value.
/// 
/// - <b>Linear</b> Attribute values are linearly interpolated between
/// authored values.
/// 
/// Linear interpolation is only supported for certain data types.  See 
/// \ref USD_LINEAR_INTERPOLATION_TYPES for the list of these types.  Types 
/// that do not support linear interpolation will use held interpolation 
/// instead.
/// 
/// Linear interpolation is done element-by-element for array, vector, 
/// and matrix data types.  If linear interpolation is requested for
/// two array values with different sizes, held interpolation will
/// be used instead.
/// 
/// \section Usd_AttributeBlocking Attribute Value Blocking
/// 
/// While prims can effectively be removed from a scene by
/// \ref Usd_ActiveInactive "deactivating them," properties cannot.  However,
/// it is possible to **block an attribute's value**, thus making the attribute
/// behave as if it has a definition (and possibly metadata), but no authored
/// value.  
/// 
/// 
/// One blocks an attribute using UsdAttribute::Block(), which will block the
/// attribute in the stage's current UsdEditTarget, by authoring an
/// SdfValueBlock in the attribute's *default*, and only values authored in
/// weaker layers than the editTarget will be blocked.  If the value block is
/// the strongest authored opinion for the attribute, the HasAuthoredValue()
/// method will return *false*, and the HasValue() and Get() methods will
/// only return *true* if the attribute possesses a fallback value from the
/// prim's schema.  "Unblocking" a blocked attribute is as simple as setting
/// a *default* or timeSample value for the attribute in the same or stronger
/// layer.
/// 
/// \subsection Usd_TimeVaryingAttributeBlocks Time-varying Blocks
/// 
/// The semantics of \ref Usd_ValueClips_Overview "Value Clips" necessitate
/// the ability to selectively block an attribute's value for only some intervals
/// in its authored range of samples.  One can block an attribute's value at
/// time *t* by calling `attr.Set(SdfValueBlock, t)` When an attribute is thusly
/// "partially blocked", UsdAttribute::Get() will succeed only for those time
/// intervals whose left/earlier bracketing timeSample is **not** SdfValueBlock.
/// 
/// Due to this time-varying potential of value blocking, it may be the case 
/// that an attribute's  HasAuthoredValue() and HasValue() methods both return
/// *true* (because they do not and cannot consider time-varying blocks), but
/// Get() may yet return *false* over some intervals.
/// 
/// \section Usd_AssetPathValuedAttributes Attributes of type SdfAssetPath and UsdAttribute::Get()
/// 
/// If an attribute's value type is SdfAssetPath or SdfAssetPathArray, Get()
/// performs extra work to compute the resolved asset paths, using the layer
/// that has the strongest value opinion as the anchor for "relative" asset
/// paths.  Both the unresolved and resolved results are available through
/// SdfAssetPath::GetAssetPath() and SdfAssetPath::GetResolvedPath(),
/// respectively.
/// 
/// Clients that call Get() on many asset-path-valued attributes may wish to
/// employ an ArResolverScopedCache to improve asset path resolution
/// performance.
