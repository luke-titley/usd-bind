# Getting started

Make sure you have cppmm built/working.
https://github.com/vfx-rs/cppmm

Build usd 21.11

Then run bash bind.sh.
- You need to make sure all the ```USD_ROOT``` environment variables is set to the install location of usd 21.11.
- You need to make sure astgen and asttoc are in your PATH.

Finally build the rust bindings.

```
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${USD_ROOT}/lib CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${USD_ROOT} cargo test
```

You should be good to go after this.
